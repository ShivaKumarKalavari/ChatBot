Feedback: no

User Message: What is the Importance of Software Engineering?
Bot Response: The importance of Software Engineering lies in the following aspects:/ Reducing complexity by breaking down large problems into smaller, manageable issues./ Minimizing software costs by efficient planning and reducing unnecessary elements./ Decreasing development time by following a structured approach./ Handling big projects through proper planning, direction, testing, and maintenance./ Ensuring reliable software by addressing bugs and maintenance./ Achieving effectiveness through adherence to software standards.
Feedback: no

User Message: Software re-engineering?
Bot Response: Software re-engineering is the process of scanning, modifying, and reconfiguring a system in a new way. The principle of re-engineering applied to the software development process is called software re-engineering. It has a positive impact on software cost, quality, customer service, and shipping speed. Software reengineering improves software to create it more efficiently and effectively.
Feedback: no

User Message: What activities come under the umbrella activities?
Bot Response: The activities of the software engineering process framework are complemented by a variety of higher-level activities. Umbrella activities typically apply to the entire software project and help the software team manage and control progress, quality, changes, and risks. Common top activities include Software Project Tracking and Control Risk Management, Software Quality Assurance Technical Review Measurement Software Configuration Management Reusability Management Work Product Preparation and Production, etc.
Feedback: no

User Message: What are the various phases of SDLC?
Bot Response: SDLC phases:/ Requirement gathering & analysis/ Design/ Implementation & coding/ Testing/ Deployment/ Maintenance
Feedback: no

User Message: What is Black box testing
Bot Response: The black box test (also known as the conducted test closed box test opaque box test) is centered around software useful prerequisites. In other words, it is possible to guess a set of information conditions that help the program through an attempt to discover and fulfill all the necessities perfectly. There is no choice of black-box testing white box procedures. Maybe it’s a complementary methodology, perhaps the white box method will reveal the errors of other classes.
Feedback: no

User Message: What is reverse engineering?
Bot Response: Software Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, requirement specifications, and functions of a product from an analysis of its code. It builds a program database and generates information from this. The purpose of reverse engineering is to facilitate maintenance work by improving the understandability of a system and producing the necessary documents for a legacy system.
Feedback: n

User Message: What is a Feasibility Study?
Bot Response: The Feasibility Study in Software Engineering is a study to assess the adequacy of proposed projects and systems. A feasibility study is a measure of a software product on how product development can benefit an organization from a validity analysis or practical point of view. Feasibility studies are conducted for multiple purposes to analyze the correctness of a software product in terms of development, porting, the contribution of an organization’s projects, and so on.
Feedback: n

User Message: What is cohesion and coupling?
Bot Response: Cohesion indicates the relative functional capacity of the module. Aggregation modules need to interact less with other sections of other parts of the program to perform a single task. It can be said that only one coagulation module (ideally) needs to be run. Cohesion is a measurement of the functional strength of a module. A module with high cohesion and low coupling is functionally independent of other modules. Here, functional independence means that a cohesive module performs a single operation or function. The coupling means the overall association between the modules. Coupling relies on the information delivered through the interface with the complexity of the interface between the modules in which the reference to the section or module was created. High coupling support Low coupling modules assume that there are virtually no other modules. It is exceptionally relevant when both modules exchange a lot of information. The level of coupling between two modules depends on the complexity of the interface.
